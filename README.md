# NLP
As I explore NLP on my own, I’m using this space to share what I learn through small projects and experiments. 
You'll find a bunch of small projects, experiments, and notes — basically everything I try out while exploring different NLP concepts. Each folder is like a little snapshot of what I’m learning, with code and examples.
